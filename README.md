# EveryStep

## Install Homebrew

Paste this in terminal:


ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

## Install Carthage

Use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and install the `carthage` tool on your system simply by running `brew update` and `brew install carthage`.

## Fetch Frameworks
Run `carthage update`. This will fetch dependencies into a [Carthage/Checkouts][] folder, then build each one.
